# go-sensors/core

Go library for interacting with sensors.

This library is agnostic of any sensor implementation or protocol.

## Quickstart

Take a look at [rpi-sensor-exporter][rpi-sensor-exporter] for an example implementation that makes use of this library and several sensors.

## Building

This software doesn't have any compiled assets, but the build process does run linting, vetting, and tests against each release.
